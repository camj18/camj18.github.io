          <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Designed and partially built a custom assist system with emphasis on safe high‑power wiring, mechanical integration, and realistic torque and speed constraints.</p>

              <h2>Overview</h2>
              <p>
                My original intent behind this project was to turn my mechanical bike into a pedal‑assistive electric bike. Through the process of design, ordering, editing, iterating, and troubleshooting I learned a lot about gears, using freewheels, power tuning, and electromechanical integration. One of the biggest lessons I learned from this project was electronics safety. The motor ran at very high wattage and required a powerful battery. In planning I learned to be very meticulous about using fuses, ensuring proper connections, and running multimeter tests before powering things. Unfortunately, early into the manufacturing process my bike was stolen, along with several of the parts I had already ordered. Because of this, I ultimately decided to put this project on pause, but I value the things I learned from it.

              <h2>What I did</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>Designed the high‑current electrical system with fused critical connections</li>
                <li>Fabricated a rigid motor bracket using waterjet cutting and manual milling</li>
                <li>Selected gear ratios to bias torque assist while controlling top speed</li>
                <li>Implemented a dual freewheel strategy to prevent back‑driving between pedals and motor</li>
              </ul>
